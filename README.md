# Crypto_Clustering
**Q&As
As you will see in the Jupyter Notebook within this repository, the following 5 questions were answered as the analysis was conducted:

1.Question: What is the best value for k? Answer: It seems to be 4. (original dataset)

2.Question: What is the total explained variance of the three principal components? Answer: About 89.50%. (original dataset)

3.Question: What is the best value for k when using the PCA data? Answer: It's still 4. (dataset after PCA)

4.Question: Does it differ from the best k value found using the original data? Answer: No, it doesn't. (dataset after PCA)

5.Question: After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means? Answer: The inertia decreased and the data points seem to be less dispersed. Having fewer features to cluster the data seems to reduce ambiguity, which leads to a better interpretation of the results. (original dataset vs. dataset after PCA)
